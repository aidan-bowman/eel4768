// A hart ("hardware thread") is one complete RISC-V CPU: it fetches an
// instruction, decodes it, executes it, and writes the result back. This one
// is single-cycle, so all four of those happen in the same clock cycle and
// exactly one instruction retires every cycle -- there are no bubbles and no
// pipeline stages.
//
// You do not write the datapath blocks again here. Instantiate the four
// modules from phase 2 (`alu`, `rf`, `decoder`, which itself contains `imm`)
// and wire them together, then add the parts phase 2 did not have: the
// program counter, the branch/jump target logic, and the memory interfaces.
//
// Remember the two small changes phase 3 needs from your phase 2 modules:
// `rf` is instantiated with BYPASS_EN = 0 (a single-cycle design writes back
// on the same edge the next read samples, so there is nothing to bypass),
// and `rf` no longer has a write enable -- gate a write by driving its write
// address to 5'd0 instead. Do not instantiate a second copy of `imm`; your
// `decoder` already contains one.
